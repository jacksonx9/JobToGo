We need developers who are able to work together in teams to build, review, and learn from each other's code, estimate features, and fulfill on development commitments to successfully launch software projects.

This package is designed to appeal to motivated, energetic, and self-sufficient team members, and strike a healthy balance between a high-energy startup culture and an established and mature professional services practice. Non-Salary benefits of note provided to full-time team members include:\nCoin+Craft (“C+C”): $1,500/year budget for individual team members to use for personal development, conferences, hardware, or any other learning and development activity the team member chooses. Uses for this run the gamut from WWDC/Google I+O conference participation, new phone purchases every year, to reimbursement for registration for the Detroit Labs Warrior Dash 5K race.\nParental Leave: Far beyond the norm for U.S. companies, the Detroit Labs Services business unit offers 16 weeks of paid leave at 100% salary to maternity/primary caregivers, and an optional 36 weeks of unpaid leave. We offer 4 weeks of paid leave at 100% salary to paternity/secondary caregivers, and an optional 16 weeks of unpaid leave.\nEmergency Leave: For qualified emergency situations, Detroit Labs offers emergency leave that provides 1 week of 100% paid emergency leave, and 5 weeks of leave paid at a sliding percentage based on months of services, from 30% to 70%. We also offer an additional 6 weeks of optional unpaid emergency leave once paid leave is exhausted.\nHardware Policy: All full-time team members are provided with a $2500 budget to purchase new hardware when they start. Hardware is refreshed every 2-3 years for developers and designers, slightly less often for non-technical team members.\nSponsorship Budget: Detroit Labs has a $2,000/month community sponsorship budget to support local user groups and events as well as national conferences and events that are important in our industry. Team members play an important role in identifying and suggesting where that sponsorship money is allocated.\nRemote Work: Detroit Labs uses standard work practices that are remote-work friendly. This provides uninterrupted productivity in inclement weather (of which Michigan has a lot) as well as allowing team members the ability to setup a work structure that provides the greatest productivity and satisfaction.\nAA Satellite Office: Detroit Labs operates a satellite office in Ann Arbor for use by any team members that wish to work from Ann Arbor.\nMonthly all-team events: Detroit Labs organizes and conducts about monthly team building events in and around Detroit. These events are designed to both bring the team together in a non-work related manner but also to introduce and experience what the city has to offer. Events are wide-ranging and have included such activities as tours of the historic Masonic Temple and Pewabic Pottery, letterpress classes at Signal+Return, circus acrobatics workshops, brewery tours, a tour of Shingle, etc.\nAll-Company training: In addition to individual training that team members acquire via their Coin+Craft budget, Detroit Labs sponsors all-company training. Past training has included defensive and secure coding practices, giving and receiving feedback, and self-defense. In 2016 we introduced a Woman in Tech focused coaching program and a Diversity package.\nPTO policy: Our team members enjoy a flexible and generous PTO package that includes holidays, vacation, sick, and convenience leave.\nDL Sweats: Detroit Labs hosts, sponsors, and subsidizes several health related activities including a 2x/week bootcamp, 1x/week yoga, and every other week massage therapy. These are well attended and have created an overall culture of healthy activity and self-improvement among team members participating in these and other healthy activities.\nHardware Lab: Detroit Labs operates and stocks a hardware lab for tinkering and hardware hacking.\nFlextime: Detroit Labs team members are responsible for project success, not specific office hours. Our team members can take advantage of flextime to ensure a work/life balance can be created and that time spent working is the most productive as possible.\nHack Time: As a Services business we often have ups and downs in individual projects, as well as team members that spend a few weeks between projects. Detroit Labs encourages active use of this downtime with our Hack Time ideology, which is a loosely structured personal development time used by team members to explore, learn, and build things that fall outside of our normal Services responsibilities. While many apps and hardware projects have resulted from Hack Time, as important is the skill and new technology development our team members invest in on their project downtime.\nTeam & Company Celebrations: Detroit Labs celebrates our successes and victories. When a project team launches a product into the App Store, or we achieve a company milestone or accomplish a company goal, we come together and celebrate. Sometimes these are small celebrations of cake and coffee, sometimes these are larger celebrations at outside establishments. In either case this prevents us from losing sight of the individual accomplishments and successes that taken as a whole provide the story of Detroit Labs’ success."}

They believe in shaping a brighter future. Whether at our offices in the United States, Brazil or Mexico, we guarantee an inspiring work environment for talented people who want to be part of our award-winning team.\n\nGuided by our purpose and core values, throughout history we have been awarded 11 times as a Great Place to Work and in 2019 we were recognized as one of the Best Places to Work according to Glassdoor.\n\nPartnering with Atlassian for more than 12 years now, we are known for delivering high customer satisfaction.

Seriously. If our customers are not amazingly happy, they get their money back with no questions asked. Our front line staff is empowered to make our customers happy. Usually, it means tapping a broad range of resources, whether that’s making sure you have all the right software or working directly with an engineer to troubleshoot a case. You’ll have what you need to get the job done.\n\nYou will not be glued to the queue. Sure, we need to get back to customers via email—that will always be there—but support is so much more than grinding through an inbox. This is a real problem-solving job. You’ll have an incredible amount of autonomy in determining how best to contribute your talents and skills to Trello. Think a short video will help customers get started? Make it. Want to write a script to help a customer with the API? Go for it. There’s plenty of room for creativity and technical exploration when it comes to better serving our customers.\n\nThe other side of support is working with the other teams at Trello. All of our teams—engineering, marketing, sales, etc—benefit from support's role in working directly with customers. It will be your job to determine how we can serve them as effectively as possible. This is no small task, especially when communication is happening asynchronously across time zones. For example, when working with the engineering team, you need to know when a bug can stay under the radar versus when you should sound the alarm.\nDuring your day as a Trello Support Engineer you will:\nWe don’t want people to just use Trello, we want them to love it. We’re looking to add a person to our support team who is friendly, helpful, and already loves Trello. Your top priority will be to transform our users into super-fans. You’ll do this by:\nTroubleshooting and answering their questions via email and social media;\nConfiguring and troubleshooting SAML-based SSO setups with Trello Enterprise customers, both by email and over the phone when necessary;\nRelaying insights from customers on to our product team;\nProviding service status updates via our StatusPage and social media;\nCrafting documentation and other support materials that empower users to serve themselves;\nWe use a variety of tools to ensure fluid communication between our customers, support, and the product team. These include email, social media, written documentation, video, internal chat, and Trello itself.\nAs a Trello Support Engineer you:\nHave knowledge of Trello and passion for the product;\nHave previous experience providing email support as a primary job responsibility;\nHave experience with Enterprise-grade SAML configuration and/or troubleshooting, or equivalent technical experience in that area;\nHave basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript;\nHave the ability to communicate clearly and positively through written and spoken English;\nHave a broad creative or technical curiosity;\nHave experience working independently—in some cases you will be the only team member working, based on the timezone. You’ll work within the standard working hours of your timezone (we’re looking for coverage of the 9AM-6PM times, not for overlap with NYC’s hours).\n\nWe would love to count on you in our team!\nPeople with disabilities are welcome."}

We believe the world would be a better place if every voter cast an informed vote in every election in which he or she is eligible to vote. We work long hours to present the available information about elections, candidates, judges, ballot measures, and more in a way that enables our readers to vote with confidence and to act as engaged citizens outside of the polling booth.\n\nBallotpedia readers, like Ballotpedia staff, are special people. And in 2016, we got curious enough about what made our readers special to commission an in-depth study to answer that question. Here’s an excerpt from the conclusion:\n\nReaders are characterized by their decision to run toward knowledge, instead of retreating. This sense of “onward” characterizes the Ballotpedia readers—they recognized a problem with the media they had been consuming and sought out a different way.\n\nReaders have found and continue to find our articles in droves. It turns out there is an unclaimed audience out there—people who want straightforward facts about political issues, and are willing to read at length instead of just scanning the headlines.\n\nWe’re discovering “If you build it, they will come” applies to our work engaging and informing voters: our readers come to our neutral oasis in growing numbers; by 2016, fully 20 percent of American voters read one or more of Ballotpedia’s 250,000+ encyclopedic articles in the six weeks leading up to election day. Mostly, they came from Google. Google has always loved our detailed, well-sourced articles, because their algorithm is excellent at figuring out what their searchers are after.\n\nThat search engine dominance got us past one BILLION lifetime pageviews in September 2018, and helped make us the 92nd most-visited website in the U.S. during the month surrounding the November 2018 midterms.\n\nWe scarcely had an email list before 2016. We now have over 250,000 subscribers on more than a dozen separate lists. We are working in numerous ways to help put our neutral information in front of people at the times when they most need it. We firmly believe that our readers, and the mindset we help them cultivate, are essential, as too many others in our industry are fighting to get us all addicted to sensational clickbait headlines and the irrational decisions they foster.\n\nAnd, with all that, we’re just getting started, knowing that the opportunities and growth ahead are limitless. If this is a mission you’d be willing to work hard to achieve, and if this is a team you’d be willing to work hard with, join us.\n\nThe Position\nBallotpedia is seeking a Program Assistant to join our organization. This new position will offer support services to various teams throughout Ballotpedia. Through the execution of support tasks and project work, the Program Assistant will play a critical role in supporting project execution. Ballotpedia is a constantly evolving work environment. This role will ensure that we react quickly and effectively and play a key role in ensuring Ballotpedia is positioned to seize new opportunities.

Magazine's Best Places to Work 2019\n\nStable Kernel is a custom software and technology firm - focused on making good developers great. Our customers are companies that invest in the creation of software products that we design and develop; these are usually large companies that sell something other than software. Check out our\nwebsite [https://stablekernel.com/work/] to see the innovative projects we work on.\n\nBesides software engineers, Stable Kernel employs UX/UI designers, market researchers, project managers, and quality assurance engineers to deliver world class applications. A typical project takes anywhere from four months to a year or more and has between 3-10 team members. All work is done in our beautiful office in Atlanta, GA with walking access to the BeltLine. Because we believe teams work best when they are constantly collaborating, we do not have remote employees - but we do have a flexible work from home policy.\n\n\nNote – We are not sponsoring employment visas at this time. If you are currently in possession of an employment visa, it will need to be effective for at least 3 years from the date of your application for your candidacy for employment to be considered.\n\nWhat sets Stable Kernel developers apart\n\nStable Kernel engineers aspire to be ambitious consultants and constant learners.\n\nMost engineers come to us with the ability to write applications on one platform with one or two different frameworks. While at Stable Kernel, engineers are tasked with learning how to write applications on mobile, browser and cloud platforms.

An engineer’s salary rises as they demonstrate the ability to build applications on more platforms.\n\nWe take an active role in evaluating our client's problems and opportunities, planning and presenting a solution, and then implementing and delivering it. This allows developers to constantly challenge themselves with new problems and technologies. These projects might contain multiple components - from a simple application to a system consisting of HTTP APIs, databases, mobile and web applications.

And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.\nNo politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?\nAwesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit-sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.\nYou work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.\nLow company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultant's pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.\n\n\nONLY local Omaha/Lincoln-based candidates will be considered.\n\nQualifications\n3+ years of experience with modern JavaScript framework experience- specifically React JS.\nModern JavaScript (ES2015+, Babel), TypeScript.\nAutomated build tooling such as Webpack, Parcel, Gulp.js, or Grunt.\nDependency management using npm, Yarn, or Bower.\nAutomated unit testing tools such as Jasmine, Jest, Karma, Mocha/Chai/Sinon, or AVA.\nAutomated end-to-end testing tools such as Protractor, TestCafe, Nightwatch, Cypress, or other Selenium-based technologies.\nDemonstrative understanding of functional reactive programming.\nCSS and HTML5.\nCSS Preprocessors such as SASS, LESS, or PostCSS.\nCSS Frameworks such as Bootstrap, Foundation, Tachyons, or similar.\nExperience with version control systems such as Git.\nUnderstanding of responsive design.\nExperience with NodeJS services (Express, Hapi, Serverless).\nExperience with hosting services such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Heroku, or similar.\nPassion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?\nAptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies mean having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.\nPositive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you."}

We provide this information to help you decide if FullStack is right for you.***\nFullStack Labs is a leading software consultancy seeking creative and skilled developers to join our fast growing team. Our mission is to design and develop technology that improves the lives of its users, while providing an exceptionally high level of service to our clients.\nWe are looking for experienced developers who want to be part of a fast-paced, dynamic environment, where everyone’s opinions and efforts are valued. We hire outstanding professionals and give them the opportunity to thrive in a collaborative atmosphere that values learning, growth, and hard work.\nOur team of 60+ professionals is distributed across our three offices in California, Washington D.C., and Barranquilla, Colombia. Additionally, many of our team members who aren’t located near one of our offices, work remotely. We provide a highly competitive compensation and benefits package with health insurance, overtime pay, PTO, etc.\nWhat it’s Like to Work at FullStack Labs\nFullStack Labs is a software consultancy. If you come to work at FullStack you will be a software consultant. Companies hire consultants to help them solve problems that they are incapable of solving on their own. So by definition, the problems that companies hire us to solve tend to be hard problems. Ultimately, solving problems is what we’re hired to do, and building technology is how we go about doing it. So as a software consultant at FullStack, your job will be to help us solve our client’s problems. To do this, you will need strong problem solving skills in addition to strong technical skills. Problem solving often comes down to being able to figure out solutions to problems when no obvious solutions exist. This ability to “figure it out” is often the most important skill possessed by our top performers. If you like solving problems and helping people, then you will enjoy being a software consultant. If you don’t like solving hard problems, or if you rely on your manager or your team members to solve problems for you, or if you give up easily or are easily frustrated by hard problems, then you probably won’t be happy at FullStack.\nFullStack provides three primary types of consulting services to clients: 1) Design and develop new web and mobile applications; 2) Take over development of existing, legacy applications; 3) Staffing and team augmentation. As a developer at FullStack, each project that you work on will fit into one of these three buckets. Some of our projects are relatively short (3 months or so) and some of our projects are long term (3 years). So depending on the length of the project you are assigned to, you may spend a lot of time on one type of project (a long term staffing project for instance), or if you’re assigned to shorter term projects, then you may jump from project type to project type more frequently. We’re looking for developers who are flexible and willing to work on all three types of projects, and are open to working on both long term projects and short term projects. If you’re looking to only work on new apps, or you’re unwilling to work on legacy systems, or you don’t like jumping from project to project, or you don’t like being on one project for more than a few months, then you might not be happy at FullStack. Here’s more information on the different project types.\nDesign & Build\nAbout one third of our projects are design / build, meaning we design and build the application from the ground up. This includes iOS, Android, and web applications. For these projects, we typically start with a design and discovery phase, which includes designing the app and building a clickable prototype, then building a development estimate based on the prototype. We also conduct a technical discovery process to uncover hidden technical challenges and solutions, prior to starting the project. To see a detailed description of the process we use to design and build new apps, please review our Playbook, which can be found in the About Us section of our website. As a developer at FullStack, you may be responsible for building new apps from start to finish. Sometimes this will be as part of a team with other developers, and sometimes (on smaller projects) you will do this on your own. To be successful at FullStack, you will need to possess the skills and work ethic to be able to build new applications from start to finish.\nLegacy Systems\nAbout one third of our projects consist of taking over development of legacy systems. Often these are apps that were built by other consultancies, and the client wants to move development to a new consultancy. Sometimes these are apps that were built inhouse, and the client has decided to eliminate their internal development team and outsource 100% of the work to us instead. The age and technology stacks for these legacy applications can vary. Sometimes the apps are pretty old, and other times they are relatively young. Sometimes these apps are well built, and other times they are in subpar condition. In all cases, the legacy system will come with its own unique set of challenges, and the client is counting on us to dig in and improve the quality of their app, and help them solve problems. As a developer at FullStack, you may be assigned to work on a legacy system, either individually or as part of a team. If you don’t like working on older systems which may have a variety of problems, and if you don’t have the problem solving skills necessary to successfully overcome these types of problems, then you might not be happy at FullStack.\nStaffing / Team Augmentation\nAbout one third of our projects consist of staffing / team augmentation. For these projects, we embed between one and ten developers into a client’s existing team, and the client is responsible for planning sprints, outlining work, etc. Often staffing projects are for larger, name brand companies, but sometimes they are for smaller companies as well. Sometimes the client is really good at planning sprints and outlining work, and other times it's incumbent upon us to help them determine what to work on. Sometimes, staffing projects can be short term (a couple of months) and sometimes they can be long term (a couple of years). In most cases, we follow the client’s way of doing things, as opposed to our way of doing things, so we have to flexible and adaptive and willing to try doing things their way. Also, since we’re working on an existing app, these projects always consist of working on legacy systems, as opposed to building new apps. And since we’re embedding our developers into their team, there’s a lot of visibility internally at the client, so professionalism becomes more important. To be successful and happy and FullStack, you will need to be able to embed yourself into a client’s existing team, learn their ways of doing things, quickly get up to speed on their application, quickly start helping them solve problems and overcome challenges, and conduct yourself in a professional manner that reflects well on FullStack.\nTime Tracking, Estimates, and Deadlines\nEstimates, time tracking, and deadlines are challenges that are often encountered when consulting. Before clients hire us, they usually need to know how much we will charge them for our work, so that they can get their budget approved and make sure they can afford to engage us. In order to help them determine this, we build estimates. For new apps, the estimates are based on the prototypes created by our design team. For legacy systems, we generally build a product road map and create an estimate based on that. Once we provide these estimates to clients, they expect us to hit them (or at least come close). As things change throughout the project we update the estimate to reflect the changes. To help our teams hit project estimates, we break the estimates down into sprint-based estimates. When our project managers and team leads create stories for each new sprint, they assign an estimated number of hours to each story. Then for each sprint (which lasts for two weeks) we assign each developer approximately 80 hours worth of stories. We then track our time against the assigned stories using Toggl (time tracking software), which we integrate with Jira. The developers are expected to complete the stories within the allotted time. Everyone misses sprints from time to time, which is to be expected, since estimating stories is hard. Rarely, developers will consistently miss sprint after sprint after sprint, which becomes a problem as it means we will miss the estimate for the entire project, and miss deadlines. Tracking time, working against estimates, and hitting deadlines is part of being a software consultant. These things aren’t necessarily fun, and nobody loves doing them. But they come with the territory when consulting. For 98% of the developers we hire, these things are no big deal, but for roughly 2%, these things are really troubling and are a source of unhappiness. So before accepting a job with us, make sure that tracking time, working against estimates, and hitting deadlines are things you can do well.\nBeing a Team Player\nOur development teams usually consist of 1 - 3 developers, a project manager, a quality assurance professional, a designer, and product owner. At FullStack, software development is a team sport, and you will need to be a team player. The rest of your team members (and our clients) will be counting on you each and every day. So it will be important that you consistently do your best work, and don’t let your team members down. If you’re more of a lone wolf, or if you’re looking for a remote position that will allow you to work by yourself with little communication with your manager or team members, then FullStack isn’t the right company for you.\nWorking Hours and Remote Work\nOur team is distributed across North and South America, and we all work during normal local business hours. Everyone is expected to work 40 hours per week, and we track how much everyone works using Toggl. Our time tracking isn’t simply entering the hours you worked at the end of the day or the end of the week. We track our time by client, project, and feature, which affords our clients a lot of visibility into what we’re working on and what we’re getting done. An advantage of tracking time in this way, is that it allows us to pay overtime when FullStackers work more than 40 hours per week. We often offer OT but rarely require it. For developers who choose to work OT, it can significantly increase earnings by 25% or more per year.\nFor communication with team members, clients, etc., we use Slack, and there’s a lot of collaboration throughout the day within our Slack channels. We expect team members to be available in Slack throughout the day, and able to jump into a Zoom video meeting on short notice to collaborate with team members and meet with managers. We find that face-to-face video meetings are more effective than phone calls, and we do a lot of them, so you’ll need a strong internet connection and a presentable work environment and be able to jump into video meetings throughout the day.\nWrapping it All Up\nBeing a software consultant is a fun, challenging, and rewarding career choice for developers. Your contributions are highly valued by clients, and the work you do often has a direct and significant impact on client’s businesses. You will have the chance to work on a variety of projects for a variety of clients, which will help you quickly improve as a consultant and a software developer. You will get to work with modern languages and frameworks alongside some of the best developers in the world. So if you have the desire to be a part of an exciting, challenging and rapidly-growing software development consultancy, and if you are passionate about software development and consulting, please apply below.\nWhat You’ll Be Doing\nWork as part of a small team to build React Native IOS / Android applications for FullStack's clients.\nArchitect, build and maintain excellent quality React Native applications with clean code.\nImplement pixel perfect UI's that match designs.\nImplement clean, modern, smooth animations and transitions that provide an excellent user experience.\nIntegrate with third-party API's.\nWrite unit and integration tests.\nRelease applications to IOS and Google Play stores.\nWork with native modules when required.\nWork as part of small team, which will include other React Native developers, a project manager, a QA professional, and a designer.\nComplete two week sprints and participate in sprint retrospectives and daily standups.\nAssist with building estimates.\nInterface with clients via Slack, Zoom, and email.\nTrack your time throughout the day using Toggle.\nWork with modern tools including Jira, Slack, GitHub, Google Docs, etc.\nBe part of a community of React Native developers that share knowledge and help each other as problems arise.\nFollow FullStack's detailed development process.\nRequirements\n2+ years of professional experience working with React Native.\nExperience with the following technologies a plus, but not required:\nReact.js\nSwift\nJava\nNode.js\nRuby on Rails\nMeaningful experience working on large, complex systems.\nAbility to take extreme ownership over your work.

We provide this information to help you decide if FullStack is right for you.***\nFullStack Labs is a leading software consultancy seeking creative and skilled developers to join our fast growing team. Our mission is to design and develop technology that improves the lives of its users, while providing an exceptionally high level of service to our clients.\nWe are looking for experienced developers who want to be part of a fast-paced, dynamic environment, where everyone’s opinions and efforts are valued. We hire outstanding professionals and give them the opportunity to thrive in a collaborative atmosphere that values learning, growth, and hard work.\nOur team of 60+ professionals is distributed across our three offices in California, Washington D.C., and Barranquilla, Colombia. Additionally, many of our team members who aren’t located near one of our offices, work remotely. We provide a highly competitive compensation and benefits package with health insurance, overtime pay, PTO, etc.\nWhat it’s Like to Work at FullStack Labs\nFullStack Labs is a software consultancy. If you come to work at FullStack you will be a software consultant. Companies hire consultants to help them solve problems that they are incapable of solving on their own. So by definition, the problems that companies hire us to solve tend to be hard problems. Ultimately, solving problems is what we’re hired to do, and building technology is how we go about doing it. So as a software consultant at FullStack, your job will be to help us solve our client’s problems. To do this, you will need strong problem solving skills in addition to strong technical skills. Problem solving often comes down to being able to figure out solutions to problems when no obvious solutions exist. This ability to “figure it out” is often the most important skill possessed by our top performers. If you like solving problems and helping people, then you will enjoy being a software consultant. If you don’t like solving hard problems, or if you rely on your manager or your team members to solve problems for you, or if you give up easily or are easily frustrated by hard problems, then you probably won’t be happy at FullStack.\nFullStack provides three primary types of consulting services to clients: 1) Design and develop new web and mobile applications; 2) Take over development of existing, legacy applications; 3) Staffing and team augmentation. As a developer at FullStack, each project that you work on will fit into one of these three buckets. Some of our projects are relatively short (3 months or so) and some of our projects are long term (3 years). So depending on the length of the project you are assigned to, you may spend a lot of time on one type of project (a long term staffing project for instance), or if you’re assigned to shorter term projects, then you may jump from project type to project type more frequently. We’re looking for developers who are flexible and willing to work on all three types of projects, and are open to working on both long term projects and short term projects. If you’re looking to only work on new apps, or you’re unwilling to work on legacy systems, or you don’t like jumping from project to project, or you don’t like being on one project for more than a few months, then you might not be happy at FullStack. Here’s more information on the different project types.\nDesign & Build\nAbout one third of our projects are design / build, meaning we design and build the application from the ground up. This includes iOS, Android, and web applications. For these projects, we typically start with a design and discovery phase, which includes designing the app and building a clickable prototype, then building a development estimate based on the prototype. We also conduct a technical discovery process to uncover hidden technical challenges and solutions, prior to starting the project. To see a detailed description of the process we use to design and build new apps, please review our Playbook, which can be found in the About Us section of our website. As a developer at FullStack, you may be responsible for building new apps from start to finish. Sometimes this will be as part of a team with other developers, and sometimes (on smaller projects) you will do this on your own. To be successful at FullStack, you will need to possess the skills and work ethic to be able to build new applications from start to finish.\nLegacy Systems\nAbout one third of our projects consist of taking over development of legacy systems. Often these are apps that were built by other consultancies, and the client wants to move development to a new consultancy. Sometimes these are apps that were built inhouse, and the client has decided to eliminate their internal development team and outsource 100% of the work to us instead. The age and technology stacks for these legacy applications can vary. Sometimes the apps are pretty old, and other times they are relatively young. Sometimes these apps are well built, and other times they are in subpar condition. In all cases, the legacy system will come with its own unique set of challenges, and the client is counting on us to dig in and improve the quality of their app, and help them solve problems. As a developer at FullStack, you may be assigned to work on a legacy system, either individually or as part of a team. If you don’t like working on older systems which may have a variety of problems, and if you don’t have the problem solving skills necessary to successfully overcome these types of problems, then you might not be happy at FullStack.\nStaffing / Team Augmentation\nAbout one third of our projects consist of staffing / team augmentation. For these projects, we embed between one and ten developers into a client’s existing team, and the client is responsible for planning sprints, outlining work, etc. Often staffing projects are for larger, name brand companies, but sometimes they are for smaller companies as well. Sometimes the client is really good at planning sprints and outlining work, and other times it's incumbent upon us to help them determine what to work on. Sometimes, staffing projects can be short term (a couple of months) and sometimes they can be long term (a couple of years). In most cases, we follow the client’s way of doing things, as opposed to our way of doing things, so we have to flexible and adaptive and willing to try doing things their way. Also, since we’re working on an existing app, these projects always consist of working on legacy systems, as opposed to building new apps. And since we’re embedding our developers into their team, there’s a lot of visibility internally at the client, so professionalism becomes more important. To be successful and happy and FullStack, you will need to be able to embed yourself into a client’s existing team, learn their ways of doing things, quickly get up to speed on their application, quickly start helping them solve problems and overcome challenges, and conduct yourself in a professional manner that reflects well on FullStack.\nTime Tracking, Estimates, and Deadlines\nEstimates, time tracking, and deadlines are challenges that are often encountered when consulting. Before clients hire us, they usually need to know how much we will charge them for our work, so that they can get their budget approved and make sure they can afford to engage us. In order to help them determine this, we build estimates. For new apps, the estimates are based on the prototypes created by our design team. For legacy systems, we generally build a product road map and create an estimate based on that. Once we provide these estimates to clients, they expect us to hit them (or at least come close). As things change throughout the project we update the estimate to reflect the changes. To help our teams hit project estimates, we break the estimates down into sprint-based estimates. When our project managers and team leads create stories for each new sprint, they assign an estimated number of hours to each story. Then for each sprint (which lasts for two weeks) we assign each developer approximately 80 hours worth of stories. We then track our time against the assigned stories using Toggl (time tracking software), which we integrate with Jira. The developers are expected to complete the stories within the allotted time. Everyone misses sprints from time to time, which is to be expected, since estimating stories is hard. Rarely, developers will consistently miss sprint after sprint after sprint, which becomes a problem as it means we will miss the estimate for the entire project, and miss deadlines. Tracking time, working against estimates, and hitting deadlines is part of being a software consultant. These things aren’t necessarily fun, and nobody loves doing them. But they come with the territory when consulting. For 98% of the developers we hire, these things are no big deal, but for roughly 2%, these things are really troubling and are a source of unhappiness. So before accepting a job with us, make sure that tracking time, working against estimates, and hitting deadlines are things you can do well.\nBeing a Team Player\nOur development teams usually consist of 1 - 3 developers, a project manager, a quality assurance professional, a designer, and product owner. At FullStack, software development is a team sport, and you will need to be a team player. The rest of your team members (and our clients) will be counting on you each and every day. So it will be important that you consistently do your best work, and don’t let your team members down. If you’re more of a lone wolf, or if you’re looking for a remote position that will allow you to work by yourself with little communication with your manager or team members, then FullStack isn’t the right company for you.\nWorking Hours and Remote Work\nOur team is distributed across North and South America, and we all work during normal local business hours. Everyone is expected to work 40 hours per week, and we track how much everyone works using Toggl. Our time tracking isn’t simply entering the hours you worked at the end of the day or the end of the week. We track our time by client, project, and feature, which affords our clients a lot of visibility into what we’re working on and what we’re getting done. An advantage of tracking time in this way, is that it allows us to pay overtime when FullStackers work more than 40 hours per week. We often offer OT but rarely require it. For developers who choose to work OT, it can significantly increase earnings by 25% or more per year.\nFor communication with team members, clients, etc., we use Slack, and there’s a lot of collaboration throughout the day within our Slack channels. We expect team members to be available in Slack throughout the day, and able to jump into a Zoom video meeting on short notice to collaborate with team members and meet with managers. We find that face-to-face video meetings are more effective than phone calls, and we do a lot of them, so you’ll need a strong internet connection and a presentable work environment and be able to jump into video meetings throughout the day.\nWrapping it All Up\nBeing a software consultant is a fun, challenging, and rewarding career choice for developers. Your contributions are highly valued by clients, and the work you do often has a direct and significant impact on client’s businesses. You will have the chance to work on a variety of projects for a variety of clients, which will help you quickly improve as a consultant and a software developer. You will get to work with modern languages and frameworks alongside some of the best developers in the world. So if you have the desire to be a part of an exciting, challenging and rapidly-growing software development consultancy, and if you are passionate about software development and consulting, please apply below.\nWhat You’ll Be Doing\nWork as part of a small team to build React Native IOS / Android applications for FullStack's clients.\nArchitect, build and maintain excellent quality React Native applications with clean code.\nImplement pixel perfect UI's that match designs.\nImplement clean, modern, smooth animations and transitions that provide an excellent user experience.\nIntegrate with third-party API's.\nWrite unit and integration tests.\nRelease applications to IOS and Google Play stores.\nWork with native modules when required.\nWork as part of small team, which will include other React Native developers, a project manager, a QA professional, and a designer.\nComplete two week sprints and participate in sprint retrospectives and daily standups.\nAssist with building estimates.\nInterface with clients via Slack, Zoom, and email.\nTrack your time throughout the day using Toggle.\nWork with modern tools including Jira, Slack, GitHub, Google Docs, etc.\nBe part of a community of React Native developers that share knowledge and help each other as problems arise.\nFollow FullStack's detailed development process.\nRequirements\n2+ years of professional experience working with React Native.\nExperience with the following technologies a plus, but not required:\nReact.js\nSwift\nJava\nNode.js\nRuby on Rails\nMeaningful experience working on large, complex systems.\nAbility to take extreme ownership over your work.
